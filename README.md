# Water-body-segmentation-in-Satellite-Images-Image-Segmentation-

Kaggle Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/shirshmall/project-3-image-segmentation-water-body-segmenta/edit

A collection of water bodies images captured by the Sentinel-2 Satellite. Each image comes with a black and white mask where white represents water and black represents something else but water. The masks were generated by calculating the NWDI (Normalized Water Difference Index) which is frequently used to detect and measure vegetation in satellite images, but a greater threshold was used to detect water bodies.

Problem Statement: Segment the water bodies from satellite images.
